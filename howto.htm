	</h1>
</div>
<p>
This website was created using HTML and CSS. HTML is a website format that can be edited using a plain text editor such as Notepad.
<br>
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and can be used to structure and format HTML web pages.<br>
HTML can be used to <b>bold text</b>, <i>italicize text</i>, and more.
<br>
<br>
The green background color you see right now is possible because of CSS!
Otherwise, you'd be looking at a boring, white background instead.
<br>
</p>
<div id="linecolpurple">
<p> You can change the color of text with CSS, such as this line. Hello purple, you're the center of attention now!
</p>
</div>
<p>
You can also display a code block, such as this Python program:
<br>
<div id="codediv">
<pre>
<code>
print('Hello World!')
print('This is a sample Python program that displays the Hello World message.')
print('A Hello World program is often the first program that new programmers write.')
</code>
</pre>
</div>
</p>
<p>You can even insert a table using HTML.
<br>
The following example table shows the function y = 2x + 1:
</p>
<table>
	<tr>
	<th>x</th>
	<th>y</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>0</td>
	<td>1</td>
	</tr>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>1</td>
	<td>3</td>
	</tr>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>2</td>
	<td>5</td>
	</tr>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>3</td>
	<td>7</td>
	</tr>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>4</td>
	<td>9</td>
	</tr>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>5</td>
	<td>11</td>
	</tr>
</table>
